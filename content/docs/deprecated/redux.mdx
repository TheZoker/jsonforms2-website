:::info ATTENTION

As of JSON Forms 2.5 the React-Redux variant is deprecated in favor of the [JSON Forms "standalone" component](../integrations/react).
See our [migration guide](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/MIGRATION.md) for more information.

:::

When using Redux, you need to wrap the entry point with a new component called `JsonFormsReduxContext`.
The component used for dispatching is now called `JsonFormsDispatch`.
The typical usage in this case is as follows:

```js
<Provider store={store}>
  <JsonFormsReduxContext>
    <JsonFormsDispatch />
  </JsonFormsReduxContext>
</Provider>
```

- [Store shape](store)
